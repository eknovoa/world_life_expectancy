-- check for duplicates
-- check for duplicates by examining country and year

-- the course did it this way
SELECT country, year, CONCAT(country,year)
  FROM World_Life_Expectancy;

-- this was my strategy for finding duplicates
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS non_dup, COUNT(year) AS dup
  FROM World_Life_Expectancy
 GROUP BY country
HAVING non_dup <> dup;
