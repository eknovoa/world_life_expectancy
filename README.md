# world_life_expectancy

This is a data analytics project I worked on within the MySQL Data Analytics Course with Analyst Builder.

The goal of this project was cleaning data with SQL.

Initiate Project
1. Create a new schema in MySQL Workbench, based on the course, it was called world_life_expectancy.
2. Double-click on the world_life_expectancy database so that you are working with that database on MySQL Workbench.

3. If on a Mac, open the sql script, "WorldLifeExpectancyScript.sql" file and run the query so that the table will be created.
4. If on a Windows, you can import the table using Table Data Import Wizard.
